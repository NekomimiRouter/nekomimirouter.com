# Peer with us!

We run mesh networks over multiple endpoints including datacenters, our houses, and school labs. These networks are non-profit, for educational and amateur scientific research purposes.

If you also run non-profit or academic networks, you may peer with us. We run [DN42](https://dn42.eu/) with IPv4/IPv6 and Internet with IPv6. We use BGP for inter-AS routing, [Babel](https://www.irif.fr/~jch/software/babel/) and BGP for intra-AS routing.

To reach us, click on the e-mail button on the top-right corner of this page.

Note: we **DO NOT** provide public commercial service, and our services have **no SLA**. We reserve the rights to accept or reject any requests based on our preference.

## Tunneling to us

We support:

- OpenVPN
- Tinc
- WireGuard
- ZeroTier
- EoIP/IPsec
- GRE/IPsec
- IPIP/IPsec
- VTI/IPsec

Tunnel protocol support differs per PoP due to the heterogeneous nature of our network. We disable IKEv1 as well as weak ciphers (e.g. non-PFS or 3DES) for security.

## ~~Bedroom colocation service~~

We do not accept new colocation requests anymore in our bedrooms since COVID-19 due to availability and public safety concerns.
